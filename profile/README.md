NCI Clinical Trials Reporting Program (CTRP) maintains a comprehensive database of information on all interventional clinical trials. 
This database helps identify gaps and duplicate studies in clinical research, facilitates clinical trial prioritization, and standardizes trial data capture and sharing.
